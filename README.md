# CodTech Technologies - Logo Mockup Design

This repository presents the official logo mockup design for **CodTech Technologies**, a cutting-edge technology solutions provider. The design captures the essence of CodTech’s brand identity — innovation, modernity, and digital precision — and was created using **Figma**, a collaborative interface design tool.


#OUTPUT




## 🎯 Design Concept

The logo combines modern digital aesthetics with minimalism.

The central symbol — a stylized letter **“C”** — is designed using interconnected circuit lines, reflecting the company’s focus on technology, coding, and systems thinking.

The clean, futuristic typeface aligns with CodTech’s branding as a forward-thinking, software-driven company.




## 🧩 Elements Used


- **Custom “C” Icon**: Built with geometric paths, circuit nodes, and digital motifs to represent logic, flow, and networks.
- **Typography**: A bold, sans-serif font (Orbitron / Exo) to provide a tech-oriented and legible identity.
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Electric Blue** `#007BFF`: Symbolizes trust, intelligence, and clarity.
  - **Dark Gray** `#2C2F33`: Used as a neutral, modern background.
  - **White**: For contrast and clean visibility across dark and light modes.
- **Tagline**: "TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS" to reinforce the company’s mission.



## ⚙️ How It Works



The logo was designed entirely in **Figma**, enabling responsive layout, precise spacing, and real-time feedback. Using **Auto Layout**, vector tools, and components, the design remains scalable and editable for multiple uses — websites, mobile apps, presentations, and print.


Figma allows for seamless team collaboration, version control, and prototyping. Assets were exported in SVG and PNG formats to support responsive branding needs.


Mockups include light and dark backgrounds to simulate professional usage scenarios.



Made with PASSION!
